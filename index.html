            <p>Dear James Patric</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              It’s a massive week ahead for global financial markets as we move into 
              the end of the month with a Bang rather than a whimper. 
              There is a plethora of tier 1 data releases alongside rate decisions 
              from major central banks including the long-awaited update from the Federal
              Reserve and reporting season continues in earnest.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 style="color: white;background-color: black;width: 120px;">MONDAY</h2>
            <p>
              It’s all about PMI data on Monday with both Services and Manufacturing data releases
              coming in all three trading sessions. The Asian session kicks off with the release of 
              Australian and Japanese PMI numbers and the theme continues into the European time zone
              with French, German, and British releases all set to come out. The New York session 
              rounds off the day with the release of the US numbers.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 style="color: white;background-color: black;width: 150px;">TUESDAY</h2>
            <p>The APAC day has little on the calendar to inspire investors and the European
              session has just the latest German Ifo release to keep things interesting.
              The North American session has a bit more for traders to get their teeth
              into with the release of the latest Consumer Confidence and Richmond manufacturing numbers.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 style="color: white;background-color: black;width: 180px;">WEDNESDAY</h2>
            <p>Fed Day - The focus for Asian traders is firmly on the Australian market at the start of
              the day with the latest key CPI numbers being released. The European session has little 
              in the way of data releases and focus will swiftly move to the end of the trading day when we have
              the latest rate update, associated statement, and press conference from the Federal Reserve Bank. 
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 style="color: white;background-color: black;width: 150px;">THURSDAY</h2>
            <p>There is nothing set to trouble the scorers in the Asian session as traders digest 
              the latest input from the FOMC. The European session, however, is a different story with
              the ECB set to deliver its latest rate call along with their statement and press conference.
              The North American session sees the latest GDP data release out of the US. 
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 style="color: white;background-color: black;width: 100px;">FRIDAY</h2>
            <p>Another day, another central bank, this time the key latest update from the Bank of Japan – as usual,
              there is no set time for the rate decision, but it will usually come out in the first few hours
              of the trading day. The London session has the release of CPI numbers out of the German states 
              across the day alongside Spanish CPI and GDP data. The data hits keep coming right up to the
              close this week with the Canadian GDP numbers being released alongside the US Core PCE Price Index data and Employment Cost index.
